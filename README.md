### ImageJ plugin for the Simulation of localization-based nanoscopy
### DESCRIPTION
Within the last decade various approaches have been established for probing biological structures at the nanoscale level. Precise localization of individual fluorophores is one promising approach in order to achieve high spatial resolution. We present an ImageJ plugin which allows the efficient numerical simulation of temporal image stacks resulting from blinking fluorophores seen in a classical diffraction limited imaging setup. Due to its openness and modularity the plugin can be easily modified and extended. In addition it is well suited to serve as didactical tool in multi user facilities helping to introduce and promote localization based super-resolution nanoscopy.
